# 000 - Name Generator

A function which generates a nickname of given length. <br/>


For this issue I'm using lists of single letters and digrams ordered by frequency. <br/>
(http://letterfrequency.org/)

Also I'm using custom "randomizator" which follows the exponential distribution, so the most frequent letters/digrams are "chosen" more than the less frequent ones.</br>
